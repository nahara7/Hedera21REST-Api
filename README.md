This the REST API developed for the Hedera21 Hackathon. This was developed in a very short timespan and was my first introduction to the Spring framework and Hedera Hashgraph technologies.
 
The objective was to create a cash back ecosystem in which all local vendors could collaborate, by giving and accepting The Jiu Valley Token, in order to gamify the touristic experience of a poor region of Romania. This cashback system would lead to: longer stays of the tourists, increased daily spending, a higher chance for tourists to return and attracting new people in the area through referral-type incentives. Such a cash-back system would allow visitors to enjoy the most gamified tourist experience in Eastern-Europe and, as a result, local economy would have better chances of recovery.

This was done by working closely with Hedera's Token Service via their Java Software Development Kit, along with the SpringBoot framework and React Native. In this API the main features were successfully developed--a cashback system of 5% of each transaction of FIAT currency, rewards, promotions, and sending tokens to both users and vendors-- all done through the Jiu Valley Token we created on HTS.
